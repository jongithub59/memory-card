# Memory Card

## Description

A simple memory game to test your ability to remember what cards you've clicked before. From the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/memory-card/). 

## Features:

* Keeps track of cards that have been clicked
* Keeps track of both current and best score for the current game
* Shuffles cards after each click with a unique animation
* Difficulty settings to adjust how many cards to keep track of
* Fetches heroes using the [Deadlock API](https://deadlock-api.com/), so as heroes are released in game, the app will display them automatically!

## Reflections:

* Learned how to use effects for updating and displaying a persisten state variable(best score) based on another state's history (current score)
* Learned to lift up state to a parent component
* Learned more about state and its relationship with the UI in practice
* Learn how to fetch data, filter to pull what's needed, and display it.

## To-do:

* Continue polishing and add flair like sound or an intro screen. (Main functionality finished)
